## Vision statement: how will this project expand your professional skills and knowledge?
This project will allow me to explore more complex problems and expand my skills and knowledge of Python.

## Motivation: why is this project important to you?
Python is a popular language that is used in many fields. While I have exposure to and a little experience in coding with python, I am interested in expanding my skills and learning new tools in order to create more efficient and more complex programs. These skills will be invaluable for securing a job and providing me with the framework for understanding similar concepts in other languages throughout my career.

## Specific and measurable goals (learning objectives) for the project. Remember that a total of 45 hours will be dedicated to the course and project over the 16 week (or 12 week summer) semester. You want to limit the scope of your project based on that time limitation.
There are many exercise problems available on Exercism that focus on utilizing important skills or concepts to find their solutions. Each week, I will select several problems to focus on. I will utilize videos available on youtube and LinkedIn Learning as well as documentation and helpful guides from websites such as W3Schools and GeeksforGeeks in order to supplement my understanding of the skills I am focusing on each week.

## Risks to project completion, possibly including:
There may be some problems that take more time and require more researching to understand. This may require me to be flexible with my goals from week to week. I am naturally curious and I learn best when I have a specific interest and can spend time learning about it in order to achieve a specific goal. Therefore, when I am interested in something it is hard for me to take a break and I could end up spending more time than I should for specific problems and could have consequences for my time management.


## Mitigation Strategy for the risks listed above
Setting specific weekly goals and even utilizing timers for my dedicated study time will allow me to manage my time and plan ahead. If I am spending too much time on one problem when I have two for the week, for example, I can use the timer to adjust my plan and goals for the week and the following week.  

## Project Assessments - provide a list of evaluation criteria for the project.
Other than completing the exercises in Exercism, I feel that my progress can be evaluated by the completion of my goals. Each week, I will have exercises related to a specific idea, data structure, concept, etc and when I feel I have sufficient understanding of the concept for the week and have completed the related exercises, I can consider the goal completed.

## Describe how you will know that your project is completed and that you have met your goals.
Since my goal is improving my understanding of coding with python and learning more complex concepts, I don't believe that my project will ever truly be completed. That being said, when I have completed all of the exercises I have selected and feel that I have expanded my knowledge of the related concepts, I will consider the project for the semester as completed.
