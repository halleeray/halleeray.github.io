## Vision statement: how will this project expand your professional skills and knowledge?
This project will allow me to explore and learn how to code using R and expand my skills in scripting with Python.

## Motivation: why is this project important to you?
These skills are listed in many job descriptions for positions that interest me and will be valuable in making me a good candidate for these positions

## Specific and measurable goals (learning objectives) for the project. Remember that a total of 45 hours will be dedicated to the course and project over the 16 week (or 12 week summer) semester. You want to limit the scope of your project based on that time limitation.
There are many shorter courses on LinkedIn Learning dedicated to providing practice and a structured way to learn R. Other courses include structured projects to expand skills in Python. 
I have saved a list of courses that I am interested in on my LinkedIn Learning page.
