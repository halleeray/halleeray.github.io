## Vision statement: how will this project expand your professional skills and knowledge?
This project will allow me to explore and learn how to code using R and expand my skills in scripting with Python.

## Motivation: why is this project important to you?
These skills are listed in many job descriptions for positions that interest me and will be valuable in making me a good candidate for these positions

## Specific and measurable goals (learning objectives) for the project. Remember that a total of 45 hours will be dedicated to the course and project over the 16 week (or 12 week summer) semester. You want to limit the scope of your project based on that time limitation.
There are many shorter courses on LinkedIn Learning dedicated to providing practice and a structured way to learn R. Other courses include structured projects to expand skills in Python. 
I have saved a list of courses that I am interested in on my LinkedIn Learning page. Completion of these courses and the accompanying practice projects will help me to being learning R and expand my knowledge of python.

## Risks to project completion, possibly including:
R is a completely new language to me, it is difficult to know where to start and find courses that follow a good path for beginners to the language.
I have never taken or followed any courses available on LinkedIn Learning, understanding the timing and pace of the different course may be initially challenging


## Mitigation Strategy for the risks listed above
Carefully explore the "cirriculum" for each course and find courses that align with my specific goals for the week.
Dedicate a little extra time to understanding how each course progresses and how the time commitment is measured. 

## Project Assessments - provide a list of evaluation criteria for the project.
My progress in my project can be monitored by LinkedIn Learning and showing the courses I am in progress in or have completed. Additionally, in my weekly updates, I will include weekly goals to acheive or learn for the week. That will help me stay focused on particular tasks that interest me. Since programming languages have extensive capabilities, this will help me to narrow and focus my scope in order to have real, attainable outcomes. 

## Describe how you will know that your project is completed and that you have met your goals.
Knowing the project completion will be almost entirely dependent on my completed section from LinkedIn Learning. I will know the project is completed when I have completed ~45 hours of courses related to R and Python from my saved courses list found on LinkedIn Learning. Additionally, project completion can be ascertained by the completion of my weekly goals.
