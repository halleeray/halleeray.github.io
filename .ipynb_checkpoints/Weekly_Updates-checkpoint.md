# This is my personal website for CSPB 3112

## Project proposal: Completed

###  Week 1: May  20 - May 26:
What I did last week :
  <ul> Read the syllabus, take the syllabus quiz </ul>
  <ul> Explore some options on LinkedIn Learning </ul>

What I did this week :
  <ul> Create a list of potential project options </ul>
  <ul> Create the github page for my personal website </ul>

Impediments in my way : 
  <ul> Difficulty narrowing down my interests into a few potential projects </ul>

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? : <br>
  This week the process was setting up my personal website, now that it is created, I will have to keep it updated with my weekly progress. I believe that as I get further into a project it will be easier to determine how to streamline processes.

### Week 2: May 27 - June 2
What I did last week :
<ul>Create a list of potential project options</ul>
<ul>Create the github page for my personal website</ul>

What I did this week : 
<ul>Narrow down my choices for my project and begin courses through LinkedIn Learning
  <ul>Python scripting course</ul>
  <ul>Find an R course for next week</ul>
</ul>

Impediments in my way : 
<ul>No real impediments other than trying to narrow down the scope of what I would like to learn/focus on this semester</ul>

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? : <br>
  Last week I focused on getting everything set up in terms of the github pages site and getting everything ready to stay organized for the duration of the semester. Now that things are set up, I will work toward finding an efficient process for managing my progress in courses for expanding my python knowledge and learning R.

### Week 3: June 3 - June 9
What I did last week :
<ul> Selected a set of courses that interest me for the duration of the semester </ul>

What I did this week : 
<ul> Began my desired courses for the week </ul>
<ul> Created a list to manage my weekly goals </ul>
<ul> Found some initial practice problems to align with my progress in the LinkedIn Learning courses </ul>

Impediments in my way : 
<ul> Time management - I am still working on creating a schedule to work on the courses and problems </ul>

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? : <br>
<ul> It is increasingly important for me to manage my time well and follow a schedule to meet my goals for the week </ul>



### Week 4: June 10 - June 17 
What I did last week :
<ul> Began my desired courses for the week </ul>
<ul> Created a list to manage my weekly goals </ul>
<ul> Found some initial practice problems to align with my progress in the LinkedIn Learning courses </ul>

What I did this week : 
<ul>
    <li> Completed the next section of LinkedIn Learning courses dedicated to learning R  <br>
    The current course I selected for the next few weeks is 14 hrs so I did the first 4hr section  <br>
    There were several repeat videos in this section so I found some practice problems on GeeksforGeeks to work on to round out the time  <br>
    </li>
    <li> Continued formatting for my website and learning about github pages </li>
</ul>

Impediments in my way : <br>
Finding practice problems that align well with the content of the R courses is a little difficult. I have gone through several websites with practice problems for using R but they are mostly focused on syntax and basic functionality. I would prefer to focus on material that involves analyzing data sets. 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? : <br>
    For this week I focused on breaking up my time studying R by doing little sections of the course each day. This definitely helped me to stay focused during my study time and get the most out of each section instead of doing larger chunks at a time. Going forward, instead of choosing practice problems online, I plan to explore the data sets included in RStudio and create mini projects that analyze the data using the  methods that I learned in the courses for the week.


### Week 5: June 17 - June 23
What I did last week :
<ul><li> Completed the next section of LinkedIn Learning courses dedicated to learning R  <br>
    The course I selected for the next few weeks is 14 hrs so I did the first 4hr section  <br>
    There were several repeat videos in the first section so I found some practice problems on GeeksforGeeks to work on to round out the time<br>
    </li>
    <li> Continued formatting for my website and learning about github pages </li>
</ul>

What I did this week : 
<ul>
    <li> Created a new project proposal </li>
    <li> Selected several problems to work on expanding my knowledge of and skills in python from exercism</li>
    <li> Worked on styling the homepage of my personal website</li>
</ul>

Impediments in my way : <br>
Finding specific problems and skills to focus on improving my proficiency at in Python is quite difficult as there are many things to learn. Additionally, I will need to be more flexible in my studies in order to make the most of the problems I select for the week and to spend time learning about specific ideas for each problem. Moving to a less rigid structure for each week in order to learn by practice instead of solely relying on lecture type videos will be more beneficial but different in how much time I need to dedicate to learning and practicing.


Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? : <br>
I've realized that I really am not all that interested in learning R or data science and as a result, dedicating time to following the LinkedIn Learning videos became tedious. Despite the courses being broken down and easy to split up due to short videos, I found myself losing focus and having to rewatch several things as if I had not seen them before. I did better at breaking up my time throughout the week but I've found that I learn best through practicing and natural curiosity, where if there is something specific I am interested in learning, I seek out documentation and resources to help me understand and learn whereas if I am just following videos and replicating the examples in the videos, I feel like I don't get very much out of it. This week I am going to shift my focus to a few problems on exercism each that involve a more complex understanding of data structures, algorithms, objects, etc. and focus on learning about those more in depth while working on the problems. I think this has the potential to make planning a little more difficult but overall, I feel like I will be more excited about and focused on my goals for the week.





### Week 6 : June 23 - June 30
What I did last week :
<ul><li> Completed the next section of LinkedIn Learning courses dedicated to learning R  <br>
    The course I selected for the next few weeks is 14 hrs so I did the first 4hr section  <br>
    There were several repeat videos in the first section so I found some practice problems on GeeksforGeeks to work on to round out the time </li><br>
    <li> Continued formatting for my website and learning about github pages </li>
</ul>

What I did this week : 
<ul>
    <li> Hangman exercism problem to focus on implementing the idea of functional reactive programming</li>
    <li> Watched videos describing the concept behind functional reactive programming and how it is used </li>
    <li> Read documentation and tutorials related to functional reactive programming and about python class implementation and methods </li>
</ul>

Impediments in my way : <br>
I had a very busy week with family moving out of state which made managing my time a little more difficult. 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? : <br>
Stepping through the problem and passing tests incrementally and searching for bits of documentation related to what I was working on was helpful in narrowing my focus and actually learning things. I was able to apply my knowledge and see it in action which helped me to gain a better understanding of the concepts.

</ul>

Impediments in my way : <br>
No notable impediments in my way this week.

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? : <br>
Now that I have ironed out a process, I just have to stick to it. I carve out a little time every day to make progress on the exercism problems and read about the associated methods and structures. This helps me to stay on track.<br>



### Week 8: July 7 - July 14 
What I did last week : <br>
Exercism problems and reading associated online documentation: <br>
    Tisbury Treasure Hunt: https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/tisbury-treasure-hunt<br>
    Mecha Munch Management: https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/mecha-munch-management<br>
    Cater Waiter: https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/cater-waiter <br>

What I did this week : <br>
Exercism problem and regular expression readings: <br>
    Grep https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/grep <br>
    Note : Despite spending lots of time reading documentation and tutorials for Regular expressions, this problem actually didn't involve the use of any regular expressions. Instead, it matched full strings, not regex patterns. This problem was a more difficult problem due to checking for flags, the possibility of multiple flags and trying to figure out how to optimize my code and avoid repeated sections. There is still much room for improvement. <br>

Impediments in my way : <br>
The problem I chose for this week includes flags that are included in a list as input. There can be no flags, one flag, or multiple, and checking for each and changing the output depending on the flags led to me creating a very long python function with lots of repeated code segments.<br> 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? : <br>
My initial idea was to just get the code working and passing tests and then to work on optimization by breaking the flag checking into helper functions to reduce the amount of repeated code segments. Next week, I will focus on that in order to make my code more readable.<br>



### Week 9: July 14 - July 21
What I did last week :
Exercism problem and regular expression readings: <br>

    Note : Despite spending lots of time reading documentation and tutorials for Regular expressions, this problem actually didn't involve the use of any regular expressions.

There is still much room for improvement. <br>

What I did this week : <br>
This week, I worked on optimizing my code for my problem last week. The problem I chose for last week included flags that are included in a list as input. There can be no flags, one flag, or multiple, and checking for each and changing the output depending on the flags led to me creating a very long python function with lots of repeated code segments. My initial idea was to just get the code working and passing tests and then to work on optimization by breaking the flag checking into helper functions to reduce the amount of repeated code segments. This week, I focused on optimizing my code in order to make my code more readable. I think that overall, this is good practice, whereas having lots of repeated code segments is error prone and difficult to follow.<br>
    
Impediments in my way : <br>
This week was a very hectic week for me due to exams and many family and work events. As a result, instead of breaking up my work into shorter sessions over multiple days throughout the week, I've had to jam all of my studies into one day. This just makes time management for my other projects and things going on more difficult and stressful. <br>

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? : <br>
In previous weeks, sticking to a study schedule was helpful in minimizing stress and helping me to stay on top of my work for the week. I plan to continue to stick with my scheduled study sessions going forward. <br>




### Week 10: July 21 - July 28
What I did last week : <br>
Last week, I worked on optimizing my code for the grep exercism problem. This was more of a challenge than I anticipated and I attempted this problem many times in attempts to optimize my work and reduce the amount of copied code. It was fun to explore various ways to implement and sort out my approach for this problem. However, every single one of my attempts, I ended up having to copy code portions based on various combinations of input flags. I reviewed some of the code submitted by other users who completed the problem and came to the conclusion that getting rid of duplicated portions entirely was not possible. <br>

What I did this week : <br>
This week, I wanted to transition to preparing myself with a good understanding of the fundamental concepts that will be important for my future coursework. I followed two linkedIn Learning courses related to artificial intelligence and machine learning in python. <br>

Impediments in my way : <br>
This week, despite being hopeful that my crazy schedule would mellow out, I had another very hectic week. Lots of deadlines and exams. <br>

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? : <br>
Following the courses with set times this week made managing my time easier. In previous weeks, I had gotten super focused and had lots of fun exploring exercism and working on problems that I was devoting way more than the 4 hours required for this course. This week, it was easier to plan out my days and slowly chip away at the courses since I knew there was a finite amount of time that I had to dedicate to the courses. These courses were the perfect way to make progress in my goal to improve my skills with python despite having a busy week. <br>



### Week 11: July 28 - August 4
What I did last week : <br>
Last week, I wanted to transition to preparing myself with a good understanding of the fundamental concepts that will be important for my future coursework. I followed two linkedIn Learning courses related to artificial intelligence and machine learning in python. <br>

What I did this week : <br>
This week, I continue my quest for improving my python skills. Since last week I watched a few videos, I want to take a more hands on, practical approach this week, similar to weeks prior. Since I like to play video games, I figured an engaging way to practice coding with python would be to create a game. I found some tutorials on Real Python that provide a framework for creating video games. I chose a simple game to start and will follow additional tutorials if time permits. <br>

Impediments in my way : <br>
Internship coming to a close, lots of projects and an exam. <br>

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? : <br>
Take a little time each day to chip away at the activity <br>
