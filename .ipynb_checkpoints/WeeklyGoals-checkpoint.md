### Week 7: June 30 - July 7
In my studies so far, I have been exposed to and used the concepts of tuples, dictionaries, and sets. This week I want to further my understanding of these concepts and understand when using these structures is preferred and how to use the associated methods.
<ul>
    <li>I have two problems that are noted as learning exercises for tuples and dictionaries to work on this week:<br>
    Tisbury Treasure Hunt: https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/tisbury-treasure-hunt<br>
    Mecha Munch Management: https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/mecha-munch-management<br>
    Cater Waiter: https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/cater-waiter <br>
