# This is my personal website for CSPB 3112

## Project proposal: Completed

###  Week 1: May  20 - May 26:
What I did last week :
  <ul> Read the syllabus, take the syllabus quiz </ul>
  <ul> Explore some options on LinkedIn Learning </ul>

What I did this week :
  <ul> Create a list of potential project options </ul>
  <ul> Create the github page for my personal website </ul>

Impediments in my way : 
  <ul> Difficulty narrowing down my interests into a few potential projects </ul>

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? : <br>
  This week the process was setting up my personal website, now that it is created, I will have to keep it updated with my weekly progress. I believe that as I get further into a project it will be easier to determine how to streamline processes.

### Week 2: May 27 - June 2
What I did last week :
<ul>Create a list of potential project options</ul>
<ul>Create the github page for my personal website</ul>

What I did this week : 
<ul>Narrow down my choices for my project and begin courses through LinkedIn Learning
  <ul>Python scripting course</ul>
  <ul>Find an R course for next week</ul>
</ul>

Impediments in my way : 
<ul>No real impediments other than trying to narrow down the scope of what I would like to learn/focus on this semester</ul>

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? : <br>
  Last week I focused on getting everything set up in terms of the github pages site and getting everything ready to stay organized for the duration of the semester. Now that things are set up, I will work toward finding an efficient process for managing my progress in courses for expanding my python knowledge and learning R.

### Week 3: June 3 - June 9
What I did last week :
<ul> Selected a set of courses that interest me for the duration of the semester </ul>

What I did this week : 
<ul> Began my desired courses for the week </ul>
<ul> Created a list to manage my weekly goals </ul>
<ul> Found some initial practice problems to align with my progress in the LinkedIn Learning courses </ul>

Impediments in my way : 
<ul> Time management - I am still working on creating a schedule to work on the courses and problems </ul>

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? : <br>
<ul> It is increasingly important for me to manage my time well and follow a schedule to meet my goals for the week </ul>



### Week 4: June 10 - June 17 
What I did last week :
<ul> Began my desired courses for the week </ul>
<ul> Created a list to manage my weekly goals </ul>
<ul> Found some initial practice problems to align with my progress in the LinkedIn Learning courses </ul>

What I did this week : 
<ul><li> Completed the next section of LinkedIn Learning courses dedicated to learning R
    The current course I selected for the next few weeks is 14 hrs so I did the first 4hr section
    There were several repeat videos in this section so I found some practice problems on GeeksforGeeks to work on to round out the time
    <li> Continued formatting for my website and learning about github pages
</ul>

Impediments in my way : 
<ul> Finding practice problems that align well with the content of the R courses is a little difficult. I have gone through several websites with practice problems for using R but they are mostly focused on syntax and basic functionality. I would prefer to focus on material that involves analyzing data sets. 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better? : <br>
    For this week I focused on breaking up my time studying R by doing little sections of the course each day. This definitely helped me to stay focused during my study time and get the most out of each section instead of doing larger chunks at a time. Going forward, instead of choosing practice problems online, I plan to explore the data sets included in RStudio and create mini projects that analyze the data using the  methods that I learned in the courses for the week.
