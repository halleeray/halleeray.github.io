What I did last week :
<li>

  <ul> Explore some options on LinkedIn Learning </ul>
</li>

What I did this week :
<li>
  <ul> Create a list of potential project options </ul>
  <ul> Create the github page for my personal website </ul>
</li>

Impediments in my way : 
<li>
  <ul> Difficulty narrowing down my interests into a few potential projects </ul>
</li>

Process : <br>
  This week the process was setting up my personal website, now that it is created, I will have to keep it updated with my weekly progress. I believe that as I get further into a project it will be easier to determine how to streamline processes.
