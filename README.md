###  Week 1: May  20 - May 26:
What I did last week :
  <ul> Read the syllabus, take the syllabus quiz </ul>
  <ul> Explore some options on LinkedIn Learning </ul>

What I did this week :
  <ul> Create a list of potential project options </ul>
  <ul> Create the github page for my personal website </ul>

Impediments in my way : 
  <ul> Difficulty narrowing down my interests into a few potential projects </ul>

Process : <br>
  This week the process was setting up my personal website, now that it is created, I will have to keep it updated with my weekly progress. I believe that as I get further into a project it will be easier to determine how to streamline processes.
